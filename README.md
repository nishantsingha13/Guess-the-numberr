# Guess-the-numberr
// it is goin to be a fun.we will write a programe that generates the random no and ask the players to guss it if thr gusse is higher than the actual no ,the program will display "lower no please" similarly if the player guess is too low it display"higher no please" when the user select the correct no the programe will dispaly no of gusess the player use toarrive at that number. #include &lt;stdio.h> #include &lt;stdlib.h>//for random no #include &lt;time.h>//every time random no when u run the program otherwise it will give same no every time.  int main() {     int number,guess,nguess=1;  srand(time(0));//every time different no     number=rand()%100+1;//generates a no between 1 to 100 its a mathematics.   //  printf("the no is = %d\n",number);     //keep running the program until it is guissed do{     printf("guess the no betwn 1 to 100\n");     scanf("%d",&amp;guess);     if(guess>number){         printf("lower no please\n");              }     else if(guess&lt;number){         printf("higher no please\n");              }     else{         printf("you guessed it in %d attempts",nguess);        } nguess++; } while(guess!=number);               return 0; }
try it for sure...

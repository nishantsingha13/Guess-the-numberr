 Guess-the-number
Let's set up a guessing game where a number is chosen within a certain range, and I have to guess it within a specified number of attempts. I'll start by guessing a number, and based on the feedback (whether it's too high or too low), I'll adjust my subsequent guesses until either I guess the correct number or exhaust all attempts.

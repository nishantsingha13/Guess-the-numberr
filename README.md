 Guess-the-number
Let's set up a guessing game where a number is chosen within a certain range, and you have to guess it within a specified number of attempts. Yoy will start by guessing a number, and based on the feedback (whether it's too high or too low), you will  adjust my subsequent guesses until either you guess the correct number or exhaust all attempts.
